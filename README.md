# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage is a webpage coded and designed to serve as a Study Guide for potential students learning the basics of coding. As a student of coding myself, I understand how study guides can be helpful, even crucial, in learning processes where there are many terms and specific lines of codes to remember. Thus, this study guide webpage was formed in hopes of serving as an aid to the learning process. However, in the midst of creating the webpage, I have also learned more about the basics of HTML, Git, CSS, and JavaScript as well as gained experience applying this knowledge.

## Usage

The webpage is already outlined with 4 main sections: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. However, the page can be tailored to suit one's individual preferences and needs. The content of the webpage can be edited through the index.html file. This can serve as an opportunity to practice elements of coding. Moreover, by opening the DevTools console, one can see JavaScript running. It will list the topics learned from prework as well as choose one topic at random for us to study first.
